So far this is still in $config['site']['oembed'].

oembed
--------

oEmbed endpoint for multimedia attachments (links in posts). Will also
work as 'oohembed' for backwards compatibility.

endpoint: oohembed endpoint using http://oohembed.com/ software. Defaults to
	  'http://oohembed.com/oohembed/'.
order: Array of methods to check for OEmbed data. Methods include 'built-in'
       (use a built-in function to simulate oEmbed for some sites),
       'well-known' (use well-known public oEmbed endpoints),
       'discovery' (discover using <link> headers in HTML), 'service' (use
       a third-party service, like oohembed or embed.ly. Default is
       array('built-in', 'well-known', 'service', 'discovery'). Note that very
       few sites implement oEmbed; 'discovery' is going to fail 99% of the
       time.
