# Nodeinfo plugin for GNU social

Plugin that presents basic instance information using the [NodeInfo standard](http://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/).

At the moment, the information is presented at the "/main/nodeinfo/2.0" endpoint.

Other tools can then scrape that information and present it in various ways. For example: [https://fediverse.network/](https://fediverse.network/)
