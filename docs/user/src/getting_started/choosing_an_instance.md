Getting Started
Choosing a server

You have to make one decision to get on GNU social: which server to use. If youâ€™re technically inclined and want to host your own then you can do that. For everyone else there are many choices available. Many of them are listed on this webpage.

There is a small advantage in choosing either a local server or a server where you already know people. Every server has a user directory that lists all the accounts registered there. This can make it easier for others to stumble across you.

Although there are many servers not all of them allow members of the public to create new accounts. The administrator of each server can turn this feature on or off.
