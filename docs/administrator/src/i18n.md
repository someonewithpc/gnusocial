### Internationalization and localization

For info on helping with translations, see the platform currently in use
for translations: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/gnu-social/

Translations use the gettext system <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>.
If you for some reason do not wish to sign up to the Transifex service,
you can review the files in the "locale/" sub-directory of GNU social.
Each plugin also has its own translation files.

To get your own site to use all the translated languages, and you are
tracking the git repo, you will need to install at least 'gettext' on
your system and then run:
    $ make translations
