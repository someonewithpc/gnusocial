            ## Groups
            Users on GNU social can create _groups_ that other users can join. Groups can be a great way to share information and entertainment with a group of people who have a common interest or background; who work together on a team; or who have a particular knowledge or skill.

            You can find out about groups on the server on the Groups page. You can join a group by clicking on the "Join" button either in the group list or on the group's home page.

            ## Starting a new group
            You can start a new group for friends and colleagues. Note that all groups are free for anyone to join.

            To start a new group, use the **new group** tool and fill out the form. Describe your group as best you can if you want people to be able to find it.

            When choosing the nickname for your group, try to keep it short. The nickname is sometimes included in messages to and from the group, so the less chars the better. Try using acronyms for organizations, or airport codes for places (like 'pdx' instead of 'portland').

            ## Sending messages to a group
            You can send a message to a group using the syntax "!groupname" anywhere in the message. If you have more than one group named, the notice will go to each group. Only members can send notices to a group, and groups do not respond to direct messages (DMs).

            You can also select the group from the "To:" drop down when posting.

            You can make a group message private by clicking the "private" button before posting.

            ## Receiving messages
            New group messages will appear in your inbox, and will also come to your phone or IM client if you've set them up to receive notices.

            ## Private groups
            The administrator can make a group private. For a private group, all notices will marked as private for group members only. Also, administrators will have to approve all new members to the group.

            Private groups are visible in the group directory.
