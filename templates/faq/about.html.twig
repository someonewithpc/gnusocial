            ## What is this site? This is a social network, running the GNU social software. You can use it to make connections between friends, family and colleagues -- writing short notices about yourself, where you are, and what you're doing, and those
            notices will be sent to all your contacts. In the future, we'll be adding support for photo, video and file sharing, as well as events, better contact management and mobile devices.
