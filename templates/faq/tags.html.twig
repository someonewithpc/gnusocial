                        ## What are Tags?
                        GNU social supports [tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)) to help you organize your activities here. You can use tags for people and for notices. ## Tagging a notice You can tag a notice using a _hashtag_; a #
                        character followed by letters and numbers as well as '.', '-', and '_'. Note that accented latin characters are not supported, and non-roman scripts are right out. The HTML for the notice will link to a stream of all the other notices with that tag.
                        This can be a great way to keep track of a conversation. ## Tagging yourself You can also add tags for yourself on your profile page or by using the edit tags button on your profile page. Use single words to describe yourself, your experiences and
                        your interest. The tags will become links on your profile page to a list of all the users on the site who use that same tag. It can be a nice way to find people who are related to you geographically or who have a common interest. ## Tagging others
                        You can also tag other users by using the edit tags button next to their profile. Such tags are called _people tags_. Once you have created a people tag, you can add or remove users from it using the tag's edit form. This makes it easy to organize
                        your subscriptions into groups and sort through them separately. Also, it will let you create custom lists of people that others can subscribe to. You can also send a notice "to the attention of" your subscribers whom you've marked with a particular
                        tag (note: _not_ people who've marked themselves with that tag). "@#family hello" will send a notice to all your subscribers you've marked with the tag 'family'. ## Private and public people tags A private people tag is only visible to the creator,
                        it cannot be subscribed to, but the timeline can be viewed. To create a new private prepend a '.' to the tag in the tags editing box. To set an existing public tag as private or vice-versa, go to the tag's edit page.
