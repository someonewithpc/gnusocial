clean_thumbnails.php [options]
Deletes all local thumbnails so they can be regenerated. Also deletes
if the original File object does not exist, even for remote entries.

  -y --yes      do not wait for confirmation

Will print '.' for deleted local files and 'x' where File entry was missing.
If the script seems to stop, it is processing correct File_thumbnail entries.
