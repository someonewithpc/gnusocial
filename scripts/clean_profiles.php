clean_profiles.php [options]
Deletes all profile table entries where the profile does not occur in the
notice table, is not a group and is not a local user. Very MySQL specific I think.

WARNING: This has not been tested thoroughly. Maybe we've missed a table to compare somewhere.

  -y --yes      do not wait for confirmation
